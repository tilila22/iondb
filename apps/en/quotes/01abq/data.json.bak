	"quote":"We're often told that we live in very materialistic times, that we're all greedy people. I don't think we are particularly materialistic. I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods. It's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want. It's a new way of looking at luxury goods. The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think, 'This is somebody who's greedy.' Think, 'This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love.",

	"quote":"I feel that the great challenge of our time is the communication of ideas. The world isn't short of good ideas, but what we're lacking is for these ideas to be effective in a public realm otherwise dominated by third-rate commercial nonsense. How do you get wisdom to shout a little louder? Many people in the intellectual elite are very scared of shouting. They insist on very quiet murmurs. This is touching, but also deeply dangerous - for if the only ones who shout are the crazies and the propagandists, society suffers.",

	"quote":"I am a great believer in therapy and think everyone should be able to have it, as naturally as one goes to school. The problem in the UK is that therapists are badly regulated and they present themselves to the world in an often creepy and unreliable way. If they could be properly arranged, they could make a huge impact on the world, but there are many bad therapists who bring the whole field into disrepute.",

	"quote":"In 2008, de Botton helped to found an educational establishment in London called The School of Life, 'devoted to developing emotional intelligence through the help of culture' by offering courses on the important questions of everyday life, including 'how to find fulfilling work, how to master the art of relationships, how to understand one's past, how to achieve calm and how better to understand and, where necessary change, the world.",

	"quote":"On the one hand he is friendly, charming and polite; on the other, there is something almost repellent about his politeness. In his autobiographical Essays in Love, he quotes his girlfriend saying that he 'used politeness as an aggressive defense' and I know what she meant. His response to any critical remark is 'Interesting', as if you have made a good debating point. Armed with his Cambridge double first, backed by a phalanx of trusty philosophers - Plato, Seneca, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer - ready to rush to his aid with a supportive quote, it is incredibly difficult to get past his cool defenses.",

As a teenager, he was 'quite puppyishly keen to make friends and never quite understanding why that didn't happen. I was an incredibly lonely, very alienated, teenager.",
