White's knight on d4 is under
attack and Black is even
threatening checkmate in one.
‘White can solve all those
problems and even win an
exchange. 1. N{5+! gxf5 2. Qg5+.
White sacrifices the queen to
remove the guard of the e6
pawn. 1. Qxf7+! Rxf7 2. Nxe6+.
White could win the exchange
back by capturing on £7 right
away. But with a nice queen
sacrifice in the corner, 1. Qh8+!
Kxh8 2. Nxf7+, White wins a
whole rook.

. Here White combines a

checkmate threat with attacking
Black’s bishop. 1. Qd3 Rad8 (1

«-. 96 2. Qxd6) 2. Qh7+ KiB 5.
Qh8#.

White trades with 1. Bxd7 Qxd7,
and now that the bishop on 3 is
unprotected the fork is played: 2.
Qc4+. On the other the
immediate 1. Qe4+ is not
sufficient, because of 1 ... Be6.
White could give a knight fork if
Black’s knight were not
protecting the c7 pawn.
Therefore, White trades with 1
Bxa6 bxa6 and then 2. Nxc7+.
In this example, White needs to
remove the guard of the crucial
d5 square. It can be
accomplished by 1. e5 Ne8 and
now White wins the rook in the
corner with 2, Qd5+.
