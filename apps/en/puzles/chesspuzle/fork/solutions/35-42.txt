used in a very beneficial way: 1. f8Q+ Kxf8 and now 2. Bxd6+. 


35. As in the previous example, here too White needs to promote the pawn by 1. g8Q+1 Kxg8 and then 2. Nf6+.

37. Here White needs to trade first, followed by a decoy combination. 1. Bxg7 Qxg7 2. Qxe5! Qxe5 3. Nf7+, winning a piece.


38. Amazingly, White here is able to force the Black king to either g8 or h7, where it can be forked: 1. Rb8+ Kg7 2. Rg8+! (this is the key move!) 2.... Kxg8 3. Nf6+. 

39. After a simple check, by sacrificing the bishop Black forces the White king into a fork: 1.... Nc3+ 2. Ka1 Bb2+! 3.
Kxb2 Nd1+.


40. Here Black simplifies the position by a double sacrifice: 1. ... Qxf4! 2. Qxf4 Rg1+! 3. Kxg1 Nxe2+.
